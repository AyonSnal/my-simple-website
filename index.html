        <h3>My First Blog</h3>
        <p>HTML is the language used to create websites. It stands for HyperText 
        Markup Language. And that is exactly what it is: a markup language for 
        hypertexts. A 'hypertext' is a text in which some of the words are linked 
        to other parts within the text or linked to other (related) pages. A 'hypertext' 
        basically means that the text allows you to jump to other texts or other pages, 
        by just clicking on a word or phrase inside the text. In this way the text no 
        longer has a linear structure like a book, but becomes part of complex collection 
        of texts.</p>
